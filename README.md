# Particle simulator
The main idea of this project is to create a scalable solution, which allows to model various visual particle simulations easily. Various sorts of system parameters should be controlled in a real-time manner with sliders or other type of user input. Any parameters can be created and controlled, for example: particle count, lifetime, force strength, friction, speed, etc.

Tools used: Python, MVC, PyQt5, pyqtgraph

Here is a gif of one of the simulations, where two different "species" are separately reacting to conditions, changed by sliders in real time:
