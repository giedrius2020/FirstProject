# Particle simulator
The main idea of this project is to create an easily scalable solution, which allows to model various visual particle simulations easily and in a real-time-controlable manner for any kind of parameter like particle count, lifetime, force strength, friction, speed, etc.
Tools used: Python, MVC, PyQt5, pyqtgraph

Here is a gif of one of the simulations, where two different "species" are separately reacting to conditions, changed by sliders in real time:
